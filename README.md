# linuxdeploy Build Helper

A docker container that aims to help build an
[AppImage](https://github.com/AppImage/AppImageKit) using
[linuxdeploy](https://github.com/linuxdeploy/linuxdeploy).

## Note:

Formerly this was an action. After much trial-and-error, I've decided to focus
on making an image that can be run locally or in a GitHub runner by project
managers using a script. Examples will be provided.
